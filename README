TwilioMime
==========

twilio_mime is a simple Rails plugin that adds a mime type for Twilio responses (http://www.twilio.com), you can respond to Twilio requests in the same way you'd handle other mime types

For Example
=======

Lets say we have a blog and on our Posts controller we have a show action

	def show
    	  @posts = Post.find :all

          respond_to do |format|
            format.html
            format.twilio
            format.xml { render :xml => @posts.to_xml }
          end

	end

In our views we could have a file that holds the Twilio response called show.twilio.erb that might contain something like this

	<?xml  version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>  
	<Response>
	  <% @posts.each do |post| %>
  	    <Say><%= post.title </Say>
          <% end %>
	</Response>
