TwilioMime
==========

twilio_mime is a simple Rails plugin that adds a mime type for Twilio responses (http://www.twilio.com), you can respond to Twilio requests in the same way you'd handle other mime types

For Example
=======

Lets say we have a blog and on our Posts controller we have a show action

	def show
    	  @posts = Post.find :all

          respond_to do |format|
            format.html
            format.twilio
            format.xml { render :xml => @posts.to_xml }
          end

	end

In our views we could have a file that holds the Twilio response called show.twilio.erb that might contain something like this

	<?xml  version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>  
	<Response>
	  <% @posts.each do |post| %>
  	    <Say><%= post.title </Say>
          <% end %>
	</Response>


Installation
=======

Install as a plugin using 

	./script/plugin install git://github.com/dalecook/twilio-mime.git


Set Up
=======

twilio_mime tries to determine if the request is actually coming from Twilio. The safest way to do this is to set your Twilio Account GUID as a constant in your application. To do this, 
in config/environment.rb set a constant TWILIO_ACCOUNT_GUID and set it to your Twilio Account GUID. If you don't have a Twilio account you can sign up at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio. 
For example
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_GUID = "AC000000xx332541df93d8d685c2331111"

Incoming requests from Twilio always provide this so you can be reasonably sure the request is coming from Twilio. If the constant is present then twilio_mime will check this before deciding 
if the request is valid. If you don't wish to do that then twilio_mime will attempt to work out if the request is coming from Twilio by looking for certain parameters. To see how this is actually 
done take a look at the is_twilio_request? function in vendor/plugins/twilio_mime/lib/twilio_mime.rb
